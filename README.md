# Assignment 8: Google VR


Things I liked about this project
  * Showed me how easy it was to make a VR game without too many prefabs
  * Showed me how to make a VR game without $500+ VR headsets
  * Encouraged me to start a VR project
  * After finishing the project I learned that VR doesn't need anything complicated to make it a game.
  
How I would make this better
  * Give people a free Rift or Vive headset to make a game with
  * Allow people to use the school's VR equipment to test a game
